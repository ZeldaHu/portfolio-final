		<p class="intro"> Let me introduce more about myself! I like surfing, edm, ballroom dancing and back packing! I believe that there is a difference between the pleasures of the moment (hedonia), and the satisfaction that comes from constantly developing and living one’s life to the fullest (eudaimonia). In recent years, scientists have finally begun to study eudaimonia. Research suggests that the greater sense of purpose and personal growth associated with eudaimonia correlates with lower cortisol levels, better immune function, and more efficient sleep.</p>

				<p>Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime.</p>

				<p>Electronic dance music is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. It is generally produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a DJ mix, by segueing from one recording to another.EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert in what is sometimes called a live PA.</p>

			<div id="i3">
				<img src = "images/ballroom.jpeg" alt = "A man dressed in black was dancing with a woman dressed in pink. They were dancing very vigorously. Behind them were some judges and spectators who were watching them." />
			</div>
			<div id="w3">
 				<p>Ballroom dance is a set of partner dances, which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world, mostly because of its performance and entertainment aspects. Ballroom dancing is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.		</p>

				<img src = "images/backpacking.jpeg" alt ="On the grass there was a red hiking backpack with a water cup and a green colored non-slip mat stuck in the front of the bag." />
			</div>
			<div id="w4">
  				<p>Backpacking is a form of low-cost, independent travel, which often includes staying in inexpensive lodgings and carrying all necessary possessions in a backpack. Once seen as a marginal form of travel undertaken only through necessity, it has become a mainstream form of tourism.</p>			</div>

			<div id="i5">
				<img src = "images/ballroom1.jpeg" alt = "There are many pairs of dancers dancing on the dance floor. The men are wearing black dance clothes and the girls are wearing gorgeous dresses. They were very involved in the dance." />
			</div>
			<div id="w5">
<p>
	Ballroom dance may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any recreational dance with a partner. However, with the emergence of dance competition (now known as Dancesport), two principal schools have emerged and the term is used more narrowly to refer to the dances recognized by those schools.

			</div>
			<div id="w6">
<p>A ski is a narrow strip of semi-rigid material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the base of the ski.</p>			</div>

			<div id="i7">
				<img src = "images/surfing1.jpeg" alt ="A man is surfing in a big wave. Due to the low light, we could only see a silhouette of them. In the distance were the coast, the beach and distant mountains." />
			</div>
			<div id="w7">
<p>Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.</p>			</div>

			<div id="i8">
				<img src = "images/ski1.jpg" alt = "A town is covered with snow: the trees are white, and the houses are all white. A cable car is running, carrying one carriage after another from the bottom of the mountain to the top." />
			</div>
			<div id="w8">
<p>Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now China, according to an interpretation of ancient paintings.However, this continues to be debated.</p>			</div>

			<div id="i9">
				<img src = "images/backpacking1.jpeg" alt ="Two large backpacks are leaning against a pine tree. One is gray and one is blue. In addition to that there were two pairs of hiking shoes." />
			</div>
			<div id="w9">
<p>Backpacks are commonly used by hikers and students, and are often preferred to handbags for carrying heavy loads or carrying any sort of equipment, because of the limited capacity to carry heavy weights for long periods of time in the hands.</p>		</div>

		<p> “Music is a way to express yourself, keep you company while you’re alone, and always give you something to do.”
			“Music is everything, without music there is no purpose to a lot of stuff.”
			“Music is a way to express yourself and your feelings. It’s something that I can go to whenever I need it.”
			“Music is a way to express feelings that might be hard to express otherwise.”
			I am learning how to make elecrontic music this semester! The piece of comprosition is coming soon. </p>
